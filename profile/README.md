# AI4Bread Team

## Mission

üçû Bread means livelihood. AI4Bread is a pioneering research track focusing on using AI to solve basic livelihood problems in agriculture and healthcare. It aligns with other AI4~ tracks like AI4Science and AI4Society. As the originator of this concept, our lab's research is divided into three 'Bread' folds.

### AI-assisted BREeding in Agricultural Digitalization (AI4BREAD)

üåæ We leverage AI to advance BREeding in Agricultural Digitalization. By integrating AI, IT, and big data, we optimize crop systems for sustainable agriculture and global food security. Our focus areas include:

- **Genomics**: Studying genetic makeup using sequencing technologies.
- **Phenomics**: Analyzing phenotypic data through sensor networks, IoT, UAVs, and computer vision.
- **LMLM**: Training models to understand the molecular language behind crop traits.

### AI-assisted Bioinformatics Research Exploration And health Development (AI4BREAD)

üß¨ In healthcare, we leverage AI for Bioinformatics Research Exploration and heAlth Development. By integrating deep learning with multi-omics data, we uncover cellular heterogeneity and disease complexity. This aids in medical image analysis, single-cell multi-omics, and drug discovery, enabling personalized treatments.

### AI-assisted Big data REpresentation And modeling (AI4BREAD)

üìä To support our research, we focus on AI foundation theories and optimization methods for Big data REpresentation And moDeling, particularly for multi-modal, dynamic, and complex data in agriculture and healthcare. Our commitment is to conduct impactful research for long-term livelihood betterment.

üëè Overall, AI4Bread is dedicated to solving livelihood problems with AI technology, making our research both heart-warming and useful.
