## Mission

üçû Bread means livelihood. **<span style="color:red">AI4Bread</span>** is a pioneering research track focusing on using **<span style="color:red">AI</span>** to solve basic livelihood problems in agriculture and healthcare. It aligns with other **<span style="color:red">AI4~</span>** tracks like **<span style="color:red">AI4Science</span>** and **<span style="color:red">AI4Society</span>**. As the originator of this concept, our lab's research is divided into three '**<span style="color:red">Bread</span>**' folds.

### **<span style="color:red">AI</span>**-assisted **<span style="color:red">BRE</span>**eding in **<span style="color:red">A</span>**gricultural **<span style="color:red">D</span>**igitalization (**<span style="color:red">AI4BREAD</span>**)

üåæ We leverage **<span style="color:red">AI</span>** to advance **<span style="color:red">BRE</span>**eding in **<span style="color:red">A</span>**gricultural **<span style="color:red">D</span>**igitalization. By integrating **<span style="color:red">AI</span>**, IT, and big data, we optimize crop systems for sustainable agriculture and global food security. Our focus areas include:

- **Genomics**: Studying genetic makeup using sequencing technologies.
- **Phenomics**: Analyzing phenotypic data through sensor networks, IoT, UAVs, and computer vision.
- **LMLM**: Training models to understand the molecular language behind crop traits.

üß¨ In healthcare, we leverage **<span style="color:red">AI</span>** for **<span style="color:red">B</span>**ioinformatics **<span style="color:red">R</span>**esearch **<span style="color:red">E</span>**xploration and he**<span style="color:red">A</span>**lth **<span style="color:red">D</span>**evelopment. By integrating deep learning with multi-omics data, we uncover cellular heterogeneity and disease complexity. This aids in medical image analysis, single-cell multi-omics, and drug discovery, enabling personalized treatments.
